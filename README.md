# Evaporating.Link

A simple website for temporary file sharing.

## How to use

Share your file in 3 easy steps.

1. Sign in to Google
2. Select a file to upload
3. Click upload

The link is then shown on the screen to be shared!

The file will be deleted after 1 day, so there is no need to worry about someone else finding it.
Indexing uploaded files have been blocked so they won't appear in search engines.
